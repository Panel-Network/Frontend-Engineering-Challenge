# Frontend-Engineering-Challenge

## Headline
Build a clone of [Instagram Stories](http://blog.instagram.com/post/148348940287/160802-stories) viewer interface. **Do not spend more than 6 hours**.

## Product Specifics:
1. We care about your frontend chops, not backend. So, feel free to use mock data or make reasonable assumptions wherever you need backend support.
2. We expect the product to be designed for mobile devices, not desktops. We will be testing what you build on different mobile devices. Unlike the Instagram native app, your interface should work well on all commonly used mobile web browsers.
3. We do not expect you to build out Instagram feed, just the stories top bar and then views to observe the stories.
4. We **do not expect an interface to create a story**. This, of course, also excludes any kind of annotations or edits on images/videos.
5. We put a higher emphasis on polished features, rather than the number of features. So, be thorough in the time span provided, do not try to do too much.
6. Please feel free to make other product decisions as you see fit.

## Technical Specifics:
1. We require the use of ReactJS. We encourage you to use Redux and React Router.
2. We encourage the implementation of server side rendering if you have time.
3. We want to see how you think and work through the problem. So, please do frequent but meaningful commits.
4. We expect good code organisation and meaningful names.
