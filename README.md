# Frontend-Engineering-Challenge

## Headline
Build a clone of [Instagram Stories](http://blog.instagram.com/post/148348940287/160802-stories). Do not spend more than 6 hours on this challenge.

## Product Specifics:
1. We care about your frontend chops, not backend. So, feel free to use mock data or make reasonable assumptions wherever you need backend support.
2. We do not expect what you build to work well on a desktop browser. But we will test your product on different mobile devices. Unlike the Instagram app, your interface should work well on all commonly used mobile web browsers.
3. We do not expect you to build out Instagram feed, just the stories top bar and then views to observe the stories.
4. We do not expect an interface to create a story.
5. We put a higher emphasis on polished features, rather than the number of features. So, be thorough in the time span provided, do not try to do too much.
6. Please feel free to make other product decisions as you see fit.

## Technical Specifics:
1. We require the use of ReactJS. We encourage you to use Redux and React Router.
2. We encourage the implementation of server side rendering if you have time.
3. We want to see how you think and work through the problem. So, please commit regularly and often, but do commits which are meaningful.
4. We expect good code organisation and meaningful names.

## Questions
Please create an issue.
